# MxrMultiLevelMasking
Multi-level mask shape generation for Unity

Script for generating mask shapes out of convex polygons and ellipses.

Multi-level means successive shapes can either add to the mask shape or subtract from the mask shape.

See the unity scene for the masking setup and demo.

All credit goes to the awesome folks who contribute to opencv, on which almost all this code is based!!
